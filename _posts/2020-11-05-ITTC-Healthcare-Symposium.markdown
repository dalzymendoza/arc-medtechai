Last week we held our first symposium to discuss the latest and greatest work happening in the ARC Training Centre in Cognitive Computing for Medical Technologies. We were lucky enough to have guest speaker Dr Michael D Abramoff share insight into his journey as Co-Founder of Digital Diagnostics. Dr Abramoff spoke about his experience in developing an autonomous AI system that can detect disease. We then heard from each of the Centre's research streams, all focusing on the application of machine learning to healthcare. Thanks to Natalie Gunn, Tim Baldwin, Karin Verspoor, Jürg von Känel, Julie Ireland, Victoria Scholten, and all the participants on the day!
