Welcome to Reachy Robot, our newest team member! Reachy is assisting our Stream 2 reachers to build a system that would allow the robot's arm to be controlled via a non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI). The system will combine the BCI signal with trajectory information and computer vision data to assist the user in performing reaching and grasping tasks. The goal of the project is to one day help people who have lost control of their upper limb interact with their environment.
