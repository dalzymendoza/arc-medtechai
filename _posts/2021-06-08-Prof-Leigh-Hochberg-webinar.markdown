We are delighted that Professor Leigh Hochberg from Brown University will be presenting our June webinar on Thursday, 17 June 2021 at 10.00 am (AEST). 

The webinar topic is: BrainGate: Brain-Computer Interfaces TowardRestoration of Communication and Mobility

Intracortical brain-computer interfaces (iBCI) are poised to revolutionize our ability torestore lost neurologic functions. The BrainGate research team has been conducting amulti-site pilot clinical trial (IDE) of an iBCI system, seeking to determine the feasibility ofpersons with tetraplegia from cervical spinal cord injury, brainstem stroke, or motorneuron disease controlling external and implanted devices simply by imagining arm orhand movement. Dr. Hochberg will discuss clinical, engineering, and neuroscientificprogress in the ongoing trial, as well as challenges and opportunities for translation toclinical utility.

We hope you are able to join us. Webinar link: https://unimelb.zoom.us/j/81604242945?pwd=ajRqLzUyYjE3NlJDK1krVkxrVFdpQT09
