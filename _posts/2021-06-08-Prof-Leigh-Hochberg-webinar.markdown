We are delighted that Professor Leigh Hochberg from Brown University will be presenting our June webinar on Thursday, 17 June 2021 at 10.00 am (AEST). 

The webinar topic is: BrainGate: Brain-Computer Interfaces TowardRestoration of Communication and Mobility

Intracortical brain-computer interfaces (iBCI) are poised to revolutionize our ability torestore lost neurologic functions. The BrainGate research team has been conducting amulti-site pilot clinical trial (IDE) of an iBCI system, seeking to determine the feasibility ofpersons with tetraplegia from cervical spinal cord injury, brainstem stroke, or motorneuron disease controlling external and implanted devices simply by imagining arm orhand movement. Dr. Hochberg will discuss clinical, engineering, and neuroscientificprogress in the ongoing trial, as well as challenges and opportunities for translation toclinical utility.

Leigh R. Hochberg, MD, PhD is Professor of Engineering, School of Engineering and Carney Institute for BrainScience, Brown University; Director, VA RR&D Center for Neurorestoration and Neurotechnology (CfNN),Providence VAMC; Neurologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, where he attends in the NeuroICU and on theAcute Stroke service; and Senior Lecturer on Neurology at Harvard Medical School. He also directs the Centerfor Neurotechnology and Neurorecovery at MGH, and is the IDE Sponsor-Investigator and Principal Investigatorof the BrainGate clinical trials, conducted by a close collaboration of scientists and clinicians at Brown, CaseWestern Reserve, MGH, Providence VAMC, and Stanford. Dr. Hochberg’s research focuses on the developmentand testing of novel neurotechnologies to help people with paralysis and other neurologic disorders. Dr.Hochberg and his research with the collaborative BrainGate team have been honored with the Joseph MartinPrize in Basic Research, the Herbert Pardes Prize for Excellence in Clinical Research, the first Israel BrainTechnologies international B.R.A.I.N. Prize, presented by President Shimon Peres, and the Derek Denny-BrownYoung Neurological Scholar Award. Dr. Hochberg’s BrainGate research, which has been published Nature,Lancet, Science Translational Medicine, eLife, Nature Medicine, Nature Neuroscience, the Journal ofNeuroscience, the Journal of Neural Engineering, and others, is supported by the Rehabilitation R&D Service ofthe U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the NIH BRAIN Initiative/NINDS, NIDCD, and philanthropies including theALS Association, the Movement Disorder Foundation and the Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation.

We hope you are able to join us. Webinar link: https://unimelb.zoom.us/j/81604242945?pwd=ajRqLzUyYjE3NlJDK1krVkxrVFdpQT09
