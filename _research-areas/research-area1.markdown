title:  "Model Development and Low-power Deployment of Machine Learning for Epileptic Seizure Prediction,
and 
Neuro-inspired Machine Learning Approaches to Predicting/Modelling Epilepsy"
subtitle: "Stream 1"
---
Project 1 aims to develop and apply state-of-the-art machine learning approaches for epileptic seizure prediction and assessing the efficacy of epilepsy medication.  It will develop two types of new machine learning models: (i) Type I models will be designed to analyse multimodal time-series data for epileptic seizure prediction with a special focus on recurrent neural network models and EEG, time of day, and movement tracking data; (ii) Type II models will be designed to analyse medical patient records for assessing and improving the efficacy of epilepsy medication, by investigating correlations between administered medication and evidence on patient outcomes.

Project 2 aims to bring together neural models of the brain with machine learning to study and treat epilepsy. This project will develop patient-specific neural field models and neural mass models that replicate recorded EEG signals with high fidelity. The underlying model states and parameters will be used as inputs to machine learning algorithms to predict seizures and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of epilepsy. This combined approach will help us to understand the causes and behaviours of epileptic seizures and build high fidelity models for epileptic seizure prediction.

His research has focused on understanding the behaviour of neural networks by combining mathematical and computational modelling with electrophysiological data.</p><p>
  
Dr Jordan Chambers was awarded his PhD from the Department of Physiology, University of Melbourne in 2012. Since then, he has held post-doctoral positions at The Howard Florey Institute and the University of Melbourne. At The Howard Florey Institute, he investigated the effect synaptic strengths have on the behaviour of a cortical column to produce epileptic seizures. In the Department of Physiology, University of Melbourne, he developed a detailed conductance based single neuron model of sensory neurons in the small intestine to predict hyper-excitable states associated with inflammation of the intestine. As a research fellow in the Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Melbourne, he developed a model of the auditory system to investigate mechanisms utilised by the auditory cortex to process sound signals in a noisy environment.</p>"
