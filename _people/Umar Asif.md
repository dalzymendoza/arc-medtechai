I am working on projects around image analytics with applications to healthcare and Neurobionics using deep learning and 3D computer vision. I design and build novel deep Convolutional Neural Network models using state of the art deep learning frameworks like PYTORCH, CAFFE and KERAS, for low-power mobile supercomputer devices like Nvidia Jetson for a variety of tasks such as medical image analytics, robotic grasping, and 3D scene understanding.
